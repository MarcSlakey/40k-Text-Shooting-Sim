"""40k small-scale battle simulator

Allows for custom creation of two armies with any amount of units and models.
Structured with nested class objects: Army > Unit > Model > Weapon.
Armies, units, models, and weapons are all chosen in the main() function of this module.
Models are individually assigned weapons (currently no limit).
Models are automatically targetted and killed in the order in which they were created.
Additionally, models fire their weapons in the order in which they were created.
Which army moves first can be changed just above main()

Currently only handles one of the five 40k turn phases: the shooting phase.

Functions:
	army_attack_army: Makes each model in a given army fire its weapon until either every model has fired all of its shots or the enemy army is dead
	countdown_timer: counts down the time until the program will proceed to the next information screen
